# CityExplore PHP Project

This project is a small PHP app for exploring world cities. It helped me practice core PHP and simple MVC-style organization while keeping the logic minimal and readable.

## What I learned
- Routing with simple PHP entry points and query parameters.
- Separating concerns with models, repositories, and views.
- Rendering dynamic data safely in templates.
- Working with forms to edit data.
- Basic pagination and navigation patterns.
- Styling a clean UI with layered CSS.
